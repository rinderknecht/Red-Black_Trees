(* Polymorphic maps

   This module does not provide a function to merge polymorphic
   maps. Use the functorial interface of the module [Map] of the OCaml
   standard library instead, at the cost of the polymorphism on the
   keys.

   No deletion is provided.

   function used to create the map). *)
