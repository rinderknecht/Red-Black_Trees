(* Polymorphic ordered sets

   This module does not provide a function to merge polymorphic
   sets. Use the functorial interface of the module [Set] of the OCaml
   standard library instead.

(* The value of the call [create ~cmp] is an empty set with [cmp]
   being the comparison over the (future) keys.

   The value [empty] is identical to the value of the call [create
   ~cmp:Pervasives.compare].

val empty : 'elt t

(* Emptiness *)

val is_empty : 'elt t -> bool

(* The value of the call [add elt set] is the union of the set [set]
   and the singleton set containing [elt]. If there is an element [y]
   in [set] such that [cmp y elt = true], where [cmp] is the
   comparison function of the set [set] (see [create]), then [y] is
   replaced by [elt]. *)

val add : 'elt -> 'elt t -> 'elt t

(* The value of the call [find elt set] is the element [y] of set
   [set] such that [cmp y elt = true], where [cmp] is the comparison
   function of [set] (see [create]). If [elt] is not in [set], then
   the exception [Not_found] is raised. *)

exception Not_found

val find : 'elt -> 'elt t -> 'elt

(* The call [find_opt elt set] is similar to [find elt set], except
   that [None] is returned instead of the [Not_found] exception being
   raised, otherwise it is an optional element. *)

val find_opt : 'elt -> 'elt t -> 'elt option

(* The value of the call [element set] is the list of elements of the
   set [set] in increasing order (with respect to the total comparison
   function used to create the set). *)

val elements : 'elt t -> 'elt list

(* The side-effect of evaluating the call [iter f set] is the
   successive side-effects of the calls [f elt], for all the elements
   [elt] of the set [set], sorted in increasing order (with respect to
   the total comparison function used to create the set). *)

val iter : ('elt -> unit) -> 'elt t -> unit

(* The value of the call [fold_inc f set ~init] is the result of
   iterating the function [f] on all the elements of the set [set] in
   increasing order (with respect to the total comparison function
   used to create the set), accumulating partial results from the
   initial value [init]. *)
